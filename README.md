Bloom
=====

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/valeriansaliou/bloom.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/valeriansaliou/bloom)

**:cherry_blossom: Bloom is a REST API caching middleware, acting as a reverse proxy between your load balancers and your REST API workers.**

It is completely agnostic of your API implementation, and requires minimal changes to your existing API code to work.

Bloom relies on `memcached` to store cached data.

**Currently Work In Progress (WIP)**.
